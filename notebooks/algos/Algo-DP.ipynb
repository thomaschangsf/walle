    "### BFS vs DP [ In details ]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why BFS is not Dynamic Programming?\n",
    "1. No Overlapping Subproblems – Dynamic programming is used when a problem has overlapping subproblems that can be solved once and stored for reuse. BFS, however, processes nodes level by level in a graph without recomputing results for previously visited nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. No Explicit State Memoization – In DP, we store intermediate results (memoization or tabulation) to avoid redundant computations. BFS does not rely on such memoization; instead, it uses a queue to explore nodes in layers.\n",
    "    * BFS uses a set to reduce redundant exploration. In comparison, DP uses memoization to store solutions to overlapping problems.\n",
    "    * Purpose and Scope\n",
    "      - In BFS, the visited set is used to prevent cycles and redundant exploration in a graph or tree.\n",
    "      - In DP, memoization is used to store and reuse solutions to overlapping subproblems, enabling efficient recomputation.\n",
    "    * Storage of Values vs. Presence Tracking\n",
    "      - DP memoization stores computed values (e.g., dp[i] = optimal_value for subproblem i).\n",
    "      - BFS visited set only records the presence of a node (i.e., \"Have I seen this before?\"), but does not store a computed result beyond marking it visited.\n",
    "    * State Dependency\n",
    "       - DP builds solutions using previous subproblem results, reusing stored values in a recursive or iterative manner.\n",
    "       - BFS explores nodes layer by layer, but does not compute a result that is dependent on previous computations—it simply follows the graph structure.\n",
    "3. Graph Traversal vs. Optimization – BFS is primarily a graph traversal algorithm used for shortest paths in unweighted graphs, while DP is often used for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When BFS Resembles Dynamic Programming\n",
    "While BFS is not inherently a DP technique, certain applications exhibit DP-like properties:\n",
    "- Shortest Path in an Unweighted Graph: BFS finds the shortest path by building solutions incrementally, similar to how DP solves problems step by step.\n",
    "- State Transition Similarity: Some DP problems can be solved using BFS-like approaches, especially in grid-based shortest path problems (e.g., \"minimum steps to reach a target\").\n",
    "- Graph-Based DP Problems: Problems like \"minimum cost path in a weighted DAG\" can be solved using DP on a topologically sorted graph, which has similarities to BFS.\n",

    "      - f the problem involves two factors like positions in a grid, two strings, or weight vs. items, it's 2D DP.\n",
